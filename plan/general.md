## ðŸŽ¯ **Development Prompt for AI Agent**

```
Build a Next.js 15 Progressive Web App for "BirthLink Ghana" - an AI-powered birth registration system for healthcare workers in Ghana. 

CORE FUNCTIONALITY:
1. Birth registration forms with mother/father/baby information
2. AI document scanning interface for extracting data from medical records
3. Offline-first capability with sync indicators
4. Integration endpoints for LHIMS and Birth & Death Registry APIs
5. Certificate generation and printing
6. Batch CSV upload for multiple registrations
7. Dashboard with registration statistics and pending syncs

TECHNICAL STACK:
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui for consistent design system
- Prisma with PostgreSQL for database
- NextAuth.js for authentication
- React Hook Form + Zod for form validation
- Redux-Toolkit for state management
- Next-PWA for offline capabilities

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Implement both dark and light themes using shadcn's theming system
- Mobile-first responsive design optimized for healthcare workers
- Consistent component library using shadcn/ui (Button, Form, Card, Dialog, etc.)
- Professional medical-grade UI with Ghana-appropriate colors (green, gold, red accents)
- High contrast for outdoor visibility on mobile devices
- Touch-friendly interfaces with minimum 44px touch targets

KEY PAGES TO BUILD:
### Proper role base authentication.
/auth/signup - users sign up
/auth/signin - users signin


1. /dashboard - Main overview with stats and quick actions
2. /dashbaord/register - Step-by-step birth registration form
3. /dashbaord/scan - AI document scanning interface
4. /dashbaord/certificates - Certificate generation and management
5. /dashbaord/batch - CSV bulk upload interface
6. /dashbaord/sync - Offline sync management
7. /dashbaord/settings - App configuration and theme toggle

CRITICAL FEATURES:
- Offline data persistence using IndexedDB
- Form auto-save and recovery
- Real-time validation with Ghana-specific rules
- Theme persistence across sessions
- PWA installation prompts
- Loading states and error boundaries
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)

COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE:
- Use shadcn/ui as base component library
- Custom healthcare-specific components extending shadcn
- Consistent spacing using Tailwind's design tokens
- Reusable form components for different registration sections
- Smart loading skeletons and error states

DATA STRUCTURE:
Create TypeScript interfaces for:
- BirthRegistration (baby, mother, father details)
- User (healthcare worker authentication)
- Certificate (generated documents)
- SyncQueue (offline data management)

PERFORMANCE PRIORITIES:
- Code splitting for optimal loading
- Image optimization for scanned documents
- Efficient offline storage strategies
- Progressive enhancement for slow networks

GHANA-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS:
- Support for local names in Twi, Ga, Ewe languages
- Ghana Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) number validation
- Local date/time formats
- Cultural naming conventions
- Government document formatting standards

Ensure every component uses shadcn/ui patterns, maintains theme consistency, and follows Next.js best practices for performance and SEO. Prioritize user experience for healthcare workers in challenging environments.

## ðŸ”§ **Key Technical Patterns**

### **Theme Implementation**
```typescript
// Use shadcn's theme provider with persistence
import { ThemeProvider } from "next-themes"
// Ensure theme toggles work across all components
// Implement theme-aware document scanning interface
```

### **Offline-First Pattern**
```typescript
// Implement service worker for offline functionality
// Use IndexedDB for local data storage
// Sync queue for when connectivity returns
// Show clear offline/online indicators
```

### **Form Management**
```typescript
// React Hook Form with Zod validation
// Multi-step form with progress indicators
// Auto-save and form recovery
// Ghana-specific validation rules
```

This comprehensive brief ensures your development agent understands the full scope while prioritizing speed, consistency, and the specific requirements for Ghana's healthcare context. The focus on shadcn/ui will ensure rapid development with professional, accessible components.
